# Project-Gravitation
Newtonian orbital simulator in Python made by my ultimate class 8 brain

# Project Gravitation 🚀
An orbital mechanics simulator inspired by the science-fantasy world of my novel, *The Third Eye*.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run `simulation.py`.
3. Enter your parameters (Try Gravity: 1000, Distance: 250, Velocity: 2.0).

## Physics Logic
This simulation uses the **Inverse Square Law** and **Vector Decomposition** to calculate the probe's trajectory around a central mass (The Absolute).
